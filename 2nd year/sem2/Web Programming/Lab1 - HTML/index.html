                    <h3>Ferrari LaFerrari (2013)</h3>
                    <p>Probably the most famous name in the automotive world, LaFerrari literally translates to "the Ferrari." It is clearly a statement from Maranello that they have arrived, and this is it. The best Ferrari ever made. And most people on this planet would probably agree with them. Like its predecessors, the LaFerrari also uses F1-derived technologies to maximise performance. It was also Ferrari's first proper hybrid, in addition to being the most powerful Ferrari ever.</p>

                    <h3>McLaren P1 (2013)</h3>
                    <p>Dubbed "The Widowmaker" by Jeremy Clarkson, the McLaren P1 is a true masterpiece of automotive engineering. It is the rarest of this lot and was sold to McLaren's preferred customers even before the final prototyping stage was completed. The car was by far the most fun and scary to drive. The P1, like the LaFerrari, was developed using Formula 1-derived technologies. The McLaren F1 was an engineering revolution, and its successor, the P1, did not veer much from that. With only 375 units produced for the P1, McLaren has christened the history books in gold with this car.</p>

                    <h3>Porsche 918 Spyder (2013)</h3>
                    <p>The 918 Spyder is the most luxurious and practical out of the lot. The car gets elegant interiors by the standards that its comrades set. It can be driven in EV-only mode (although it won't even reach the next traffic signal). It can give you higher fuel economy than a Wagon-R. But who'd buy such a car for its practicality, right? It is the most underrated one out of the three. It cannot compete with the classy Ferrari design or the curvaceous design of the P1, but it does well for itself. The rear end and the top-mounted exhausts are a sight to just sit and admire. Too bad Porsche only built 918 units for the car!</p>
